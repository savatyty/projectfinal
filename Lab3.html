    <h1>Networking Lab:</h1>
    <p>
        The infrastructure of the Networking Laboratory was designed to simulate a network connecting multiple devices such as computers, servers, and printers with different types of physical communication links. The interconnections between these virtual locations are slightly asymmetric, permitting interesting routing phenomena to be demonstrated. This laboratory is designed for the purpose of enhancing student’s understanding of the concepts discussed in a variety of networks and data communication. The Networking Laboratory also reinforces fundamental concepts and theories associated with the network’s physical layer, data link layer, network layer, transport layer, and application layer. The lab Includes simu¬lations devoted to Internet activities, Windows Server or Linux, and PC hardware.
